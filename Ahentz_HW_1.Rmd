# Question one
sum(cubs$W)
sum(cubs$L)

# Wins: 11141    Losses: 10592

# Question 2
which.max(cubs$R)
cubs[129,]
which.min(cubs$R)
cubs[3,]

# Year for most runs: 1894   Least runs: 2020

# 2020 was the year of covid season so it makes sense that their runs are the lowest of all seasons

# Question 3
sum(cubs$Attendance > 3000000)
temp <- cubs$Attendance[!is.na(cubs$Attendance)]
sum(temp > 3000000)

# 12 years with over 3 million in attendence
